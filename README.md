The JavaScript code contained in the script.js file was written entirely by
myself. However, for this challenge we were provided with all of the content in
the index.html and style.css files. The content in those files was provided by
edX as part of their Front End Web Development bootcamp. In addition, this
project makes use of the Bootstrap framework and JQuery library for which I can
take no credit.
