This page should load in any modern browser. To use the scheduler, simply open
the schedule page and click in any of the text areas -- these will be the grey,
red and green coloured areas between the hour labels and the blue save buttons.
Having clicked inside these areas, you should be able to add a description of
your schedule within the text area. Following this, clicking on the save button
should save any scheduled events to your browser's local storage. Please note
that as a result, if this page is opened in private browsing/incognito mode,
scheduled events will not be saved.

The JavaScript code contained in the script.js file was written entirely by
myself. However, for this challenge we were provided with all of the content in
the index.html and style.css files. The content in those files was provided by
edX as part of their Front End Web Development bootcamp. In addition, this
project makes use of the Bootstrap framework and JQuery library for which I can
take no credit.
